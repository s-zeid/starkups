# What does it look like?

It looks like this:

    Title
    Subtitle
    
    
    Entry 1	(that's a tab stop) Name of entry
    **Lorem ipsum**, dolor *sit* amet....
    
    Yes, Markdown is supported!
    
    
    * Entry 2	This one's important!
    Each entry is separated by *two* blank lines.  There's also two blank lines
    before the first entry.

Cool, huh?


# How do I use it?

Just put your Starkups in a file, and then open it in the viewer.

You can also make a static HTML file by clicking the Save as HTML button once
you've opened a file.  There's also a Python script in the source tree at
`viewer/make-static` that will do it for you.


# Can you see my stuff?

**No.**  Starkups runs entirely on your computer.  Nothing is sent to my server,
and you can make sure of that by looking at the source code.


# Where's the source code?

[Over here.](https://gitlab.com/scottywz/starkups)  It's written in JavaScript

# Why's it called "Starkups"?

It's a play on "Starbucks" and "markup".


# Why "Starbucks"?  I thought you don't drink coffee?

I don't.  It's a long story.


# Ooh, Material!

Yep :)  [Praise DuARTe!](http://duarte.cf/ "Warning: Auto-playing video")
